# Blowfish Cipher Algorithm in Java

Download source code here: [Blowfish.tar.gz](http://www.olafrv.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Blowfish.tar.gz) An implementation on Blowfish cipher algorithm in Java, based on: * [Bruce Schneier (2009)](http://www.schneier.com/paper-blowfish-fse.html) * [Dr. Herong Yang (2009)](http://www.herongyang.com/crypto/cipher_blowfish.html) * [Wikipedia (2009)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_\(cipher\)) * [DI Managment (2009)](http://www.di-mgt.com.au/cryptopad.html) Copyright (C) Dec 23th, 2009 - Olaf Reitmaier Veracierta This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

**[Olaf Reitmaier Veracierta](#11 "2010-03-13 09:06:43"):** I have wrote it with the standard design of the author of blowfish (Bruce Schneier) see <http://www.schneier.com/paper-blowfish-fse.html> I wrote it for blackberry commecial applications and for personal use. I talked to Bruce and he told me it's better today to use twofish instead of blowfish, I'll write soon the twofish algorithm too. Regards.-

I tried to download the Blowfish.tar file from the mentioned link.. But sadly it shows error 404.. It would be really helpful if you could mail me the file.. Im in a great urgent..
