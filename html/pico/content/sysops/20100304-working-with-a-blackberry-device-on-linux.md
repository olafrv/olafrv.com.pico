> This software and task have been tested on a Blackberry (bb) 8520 device

First, you must download and install "Barry" a suite of blackberry tools for GNU/Linux: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/barry/> Then, you must install all downloaded packages for debian (ubuntu) such as: 

> barry-util barrybackup-gui libbarry0 opensync-plugin-barry opensync-plugin-barry-dbg 

Use dpkg -i  to install each package. To know what command names have been installed run: 

```bash
    dpkg --listfiles barry-util | grep bin
    dpkg --listfiles barrybackup-gui | grep bin
```

Then, here you are: Export (save) address book from bb to LDIF file 

```bash
    btool -c "" > bb.ldif
```

Import to bb an address book LDIF file (Test) 

```bash
    upldif < bb.ldif
```

Import to bb an address book LDIF file (Do it!!! I will delete all contacts on bb device!!!) 

```bash
    upldif -u < bb.ldif
```

List LDIF/LDAP Mapping between Barry fields and bb device database fields

```bash
    btool -M
```

List all bb device database names (some can't be saved) 

```bash
    btool -t
```

Dump in Bin Hex format a database (I think is only for programmers) 

```bash
    btool -d "Address Book"
```

> Previously to using these commands I needed to export my Mozilla Thunderbird address book to LDIF file, then import it to bb device.

Also you can convert a comma separated file (CSV) and convert it to LDIF with this script: 

```bash
    #!/bin/bash
